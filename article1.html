            <h3><br>Introduction</h3>
            <p><br>Boba is everywhere. In 2021, the bubble tea market was valued at $2.17 billion. It is expected to grow to $3.78 billion - over 170% - by the year 2030. Over the past 30 years, the drink has spread from Taiwan to all corners of the world, becoming a universal cultural icon. However, despite its popularity, bubble tea's origins, history and manufacturing process remain relatively unknown to the general public. Don't just drink boba - understand it.</p>
            <h3><br>Cassava</h3>
            <p><br>Cassava, also known as yuca and tapioca, is a shrub that grows primarily in tropical and savanna climates. It requires a temperature of 25-27°C for optimal growth, with growth stopping completely at temperatures below 10℃. Cassava can grow in regions with erratic rainfall and is able to survive extreme droughts. For this reason, it has been used as a staple food in regions of Africa and South America for centuries. The plant can reach heights of up to 7 meters and has lush, tropical leaves; however, its most remarkable source of nutrition lies hidden beneath the soil.
            </p>
            <p>The roots of the cassava plant, also known as tubers, can reach 38 cm in length and 16 cm in diameter. They have a very high starch content - this is the raw ingredient from which boba "pearls" are made - and also contain small amounts of calcium, phosphorus and vitamin C. However, cassava cannot be eaten raw - when digested in the gastrointestinal tract, the linamarin contained in cassava roots reacts with enzymes to release hydrogen cyanide, also known as cyanide. The source of boba beads is actually highly toxic. Although processed cassava is generally safe to eat, cyanide poisoning from eating raw or poorly processed tubers is not uncommon, especially during droughts when cyanide levels rise above normal. Most of the cyanide in cassava tubers is contained in the outer skin and serves as a defense mechanism to prevent ingestion by wildlife. It is worth noting that cyanide content varies and is correlated with the "bitterness" of the cassava variety. While sweeter varieties can contain as little as 20 mg of HCN per kilogram, more bitter varieties can contain up to 1000 mg per kilogram and can prove highly dangerous if improperly processed, especially if consumed by individuals deficient in vitamin B12. </p>
            <p><br>Cassava is generally grown by smallholders in areas unsuitable for other crops and is cultivated by hand using traditional methods. Because cassava is a tropical crop, the largest exporters are Nigeria (19%), the Democratic Republic of Congo (13%), and Thailand (10%). While Nigeria is the world's largest producer of raw cassava, it lacks the technology to process it.</p>
            <h3><br>Tapioca starch</h3>
            <p><br>Once harvested, raw cassava is processed into tapioca starch, also known as tapioca flour. Although it is possible to produce cassava starch without specialized equipment, the process is labor-intensive and the resulting starch is generally of mediocre quality. The production of high-quality cassava starch requires a multi-step production process and specialized machinery. First, raw cassava sticks are cut and washed using a drying sieve and paddle washer. The rods are then ground up into powder, which is sifted and refined. The subsequent dewatering and drying stage is a critical part of the starch production process, reducing the moisture content of the starch to the desired 8-10%. After drying, tapioca starch is packaged and ready for consumption.</p>
            <p>The world's leading exporters of tapioca flour are Thailand and Vietnam, which control 96% of the $2 billion industry; Thailand alone exports 2 million megatons per year. In addition to being one of the three ingredients needed to make boba pearls, tapioca starch has a wide range of applications in various industries. In particular, it is used in the textile, paper and glue industries for its lubricating and adhesive properties. It is also widely used throughout the food industry as a thickening agent and is a common ingredient in gluten-free products.</p>

            <p><br>However, the cassava starch production process is not without its shortcomings and has been known to cause environmental problems in Southeast Asian countries. The process is highly water-intensive, requiring approximately 10 kL of water per ton of starch. When wastewater is drained irresponsibly, the cyanide in the cassava roots contaminates the surrounding environment, lowering the pH of the water to critical levels. A proposed solution to this problem is the use of anaerobic sludge blanket reactors, which have proven effective in significantly reducing the concentration of cyanide in cassava starch effluent.
