            <p><br>Boba is everywhere. In 2021, the bubble tea market was valued at $2.17 billion, and it is expected to grow to $3.78 billion - over 170% - by the year 2030. Over the past 30 years, the delightfully creamy beverage has spread from Taiwan to all corners of the world, becoming both a cultural icon and a booming industry in the process. However, despite its monumental popularity, bubble tea's origins, history and production process remain relatively unknown to the general public, with the vast majority all but unaware of the drink's humble origins. Read on to see how bubble tea has become the signature dessert that it is today. Don’t just drink boba - understand it. </p>
            <p><br>The plant most frequently used to produce boba pearls is, in fact, native to South America. Cassava, also known as yuca and tapioca, is a resilient shrub that grows primarily in tropical and savanna climates. It requires a temperature of 25-27°C for optimal growth, with growth stopping entirely at temperatures below 10°C. Cassava can grow in regions with erratic rainfall and is able to survive extreme droughts, which has allowed it to be used as a staple food in regions of Africa and South America for centuries. The mighty plant can reach heights of up to 7 meters and has lush, tropical leaves; however, it hides its most valuable asset beneath the soil. </p>
            <p><br>The roots of the cassava plant, also known as tubers, can reach 38 cm in length and 16 cm in diameter. They contain high amounts of starch - a key ingredient in the production of boba pearls - and also contain small amounts of calcium, phosphorus and vitamin C. However, cassava roots cannot be eaten raw - when digested in the gastrointestinal tract, the linamarin contained in the roots reacts with enzymes to release hydrogen cyanide, which is highly toxic and can be deadly if a sufficient amount is consumed. Although processed cassava is generally safe to eat, cyanide poisoning as a result of eating raw or poorly processed tubers is not uncommon, especially during droughts, when cyanide levels rise above normal. It is worth noting that cyanide content varies across plants and is correlated with the "bitterness" of the cassava variety. While sweeter varieties can contain as little as 20 mg of HCN per kilogram, more bitter varieties can contain up to 1000 mg per kilogram and can prove highly dangerous if improperly processed, especially if consumed by individuals deficient in vitamin B12. </p>
            <p><br>Cassava is generally grown by smallholders in areas unsuitable for other crops and is cultivated by hand using traditional methods. The largest exporters as of 2021 are Nigeria (19%), the Democratic Republic of Congo (13%), and Thailand (10%). However, while Nigeria is the world's largest producer of raw cassava, it lacks the technology to process it.</p>

            <p><br>Once harvested, raw cassava is processed into tapioca starch, also known as tapioca flour. Although it is possible to produce cassava starch without specialized equipment, the process is labor-intensive and the resulting starch is generally of mediocre quality. The production of high-quality cassava starch requires a multi-step process and specialized machinery. First, raw cassava sticks are cut and washed using a drying sieve and paddle washer. The rods are then ground up into powder, which is sifted and refined. The subsequent dewatering and drying stage is a critical part of the starch production process, reducing the moisture content of the starch to the desired 8-10%. After drying, tapioca starch is packaged and ready for consumption. </p>
            <p><br>The world's leading exporters of tapioca flour are Thailand and Vietnam, which control 96% of the $2 billion industry; Thailand alone exports 2 million megatons per year. Cassava starch is highly versatile -  in addition to being a necessary ingredient in boba pearl production, tapioca starch has a wide range of applications in various industries. In particular, it is used in the textile, paper and glue industries for its lubricating and adhesive properties. It is also widely used throughout the food industry as a thickening agent and is a common ingredient in gluten-free products.</p>

            <p><br>However, the cassava starch production process is not without its shortcomings and has been known to cause significant environmental damage throughout Southeast Asia. The process is highly water-intensive, requiring approximately 10 kL of water per ton of starch. When wastewater is drained irresponsibly, the cyanide in the cassava roots contaminates the surrounding environment, lowering the pH of the water to critical levels. A proposed solution to this problem is the use of anaerobic sludge blanket reactors, which have proven effective in significantly reducing the concentration of cyanide in cassava starch effluent.</p>
            <p><br>Despite the sophistication of the modern tapioca industry's production process, tapioca desserts have been a staple food in Southeast Asia for hundreds of years. For example, bilo-bilo, a Filipino dessert, consists of jackfruit, bananas, and tapioca pearls; es campur, meanwhile, is an Indonesian dish consisting of tapioca pearls mixed with various ingredients and served in shaved ice. However, despite the large variety of tapioca-based desserts, none have even come close to reaching the international popularity of bubble tea. </p>
            <p><br>Two teahouses in Taiwan, Chun Shui Tang and Hanlin Tea Room, claim to have invented boba tea in the late eighties. While the exact way in which boba was created is disputed, the owners of both teahouses claim to have arrived at the recipe by adding tapioca starch balls to milk tea. Boba’s sudden surge in popularity during the nineties is likely to have been caused by the advent of cafe culture, with Western chains such as Starbucks expanding into East and Southeast Asia. </p>
            <p><br>The factors behind boba’s continued widespread popularity are ambiguous - perhaps its the unconventional harmony of creamy beverage combined with chewy pearls, or the ability to be enjoyed on-the-go - however, there is one aspect of bubble tea that allows it to remain as popular as it is. </p>
            <p><br>In a world of rapidly changing taste trends, boba is able to continuously evolve, to alter its form and seamlessly integrate into new waves of aesthetic and retain its popularity among generations. During the nineties, for instance, fruits used for production were replaced with syrups and powders to cut costs and increase profit - however, as demand for authentic ingredients increased, bubble tea returned to its organic roots. Even the ‘milk’ in milk tea has long been replaced - in spite of its name, modern milk tea is generally made with non-dairy creamer, which is responsible for the drink's delicate, creamy texture. The bubble tea market is one of endless innovation, with creative trends ranging from popping pearls to cheese foam appearing on a regular basis. </p>
            <p><br>Although the exact reason for boba tea’s rise to fame is debatable, one thing is for certain - from its sophisticated production process to its rich history and socioeconomic significance, bubble tea is a drink like no other. As decades pass, the tapioca-based dessert continues to win the hearts of generations across the world - sweet, gooey, resilient, it comforts consumers and hits record sales across the globe, its distinctive flavor becoming an irresistible addiction. In a world of rapid change and constant innovation, boba remains antifragile.</p>
