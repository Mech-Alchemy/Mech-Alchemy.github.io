            <p><br>Smell is a sense that should not be overlooked when it comes to making an impression. Not only for making an impression on other people— whether it's a family gathering, a romantic night out, or a first day on the job - but also for making an impression on your own brain. Scents and odors travel directly to the limbic system, which is responsible for emotion and memory. What this means is that your brain instantaneously associates emotions with what you smell. Perhaps you’re out for a day at the beach, and the salty ocean breeze greets you with a distinct sense of relaxation. The smell of baking cookies makes you feel warm and cozy, as their sweet, chocolatey decadence can be almost tasted through the closed oven. The scent of fresh vegetation on a morning hike— or of wet concrete walking home in the rain. All of these positive emotions and memories are only possible due to the abilities of the limbic system. On the other hand, a terrible smell might completely terrorize a memory. Taking a nice stroll in the city is interrupted by an alleyway full of open garbage cans. The fish market comes into town. Your classmate decides that once every three days qualifies for basic hygiene. All of these wafts, odors, and smells are each associated with some sort of memory or emotion. Regardless of circumstances— smell creates the subconscious background of each waking moment. </p>
            <p><br>Perfume manufacturers have taken advantage of this sensory phenomenon for millennia. Developing perfumes used to compliment one’s character and create a fragrant impression in each moment, people in cultures around the world have commonly used perfumes to establish better impressions– and quite simply, to smell better. The earliest recorded perfumes can be traced back to ancient Mesopotamia. In 1200 BC, a woman by the name of Tapputi was the earliest recorded chemist and perfume-maker. Since then, perfume has transformed into a global industry. In 2022, the global market value of perfume was valued at USD 45.85 billion. In addition to the fragrance industry, perfume has also become a staple in the beauty, cosmetics, and high fashion industries internationally. Perfumes have become a symbol of class, status, and charisma–and for many, are impossible to live without. But how exactly are perfumes made? Don’t just wear it- understand it. </p>
            <p><br>In antiquity, perfumes took form through scented oils, known as absolute, and incense. They were used for religious offerings, as medicine, or as a key component of basic hygiene. Absolute would first need to be collected from natural aromatic substances through methods of extraction. There are five primary methods for the extraction of these oils: expression, enfleurage, maceration, distillation, and solvent extraction. Expression is the oldest and simplest of the five. Imagine squeezing an orange. Its citrusy, sweet scent flows into the air as the juice is poured into a glass. The process of expression is similar—if not identical. To extract a fragrance, the aromatic substance is simply crushed and pressed until all of its natural oils are collected. Typically, this process is used for fruit or citrus-based oils, since the low cost of growing, harvesting, and pressing citrus fruits makes their oils cost less than most other essential oils or fragrances. </p> 
            <p><br>Enfleurage, a method developed and used in Ancient Egypt is the second means of extracting absolute. It was considered advantageous due to its ability to extract the oils of delicate flowers that could not withstand the force of other extraction methods. However, it is not commonly used in the modern day due to its low efficiency in comparison to other processes. The enfleurage method places the flowers in an oil or fat base on a sheet of glass. Over time, the base absorbs the fragrance of the flowers creating a scented oil that can be used for perfumery. </p>
            <p><br>The third process, hot enfleurage, also known as maceration, was used by the ancient Greeks and Romans to extract absolute from flowers that could tolerate higher temperatures. It uses the same process of enfleurage, except that the fat base is heated to a liquified state before coming into contact with flowers. </p>
            <p><br>The fourth method of extraction is known as distillation and requires passing steam through a plant to volatilize and condense the evaporated absolute. This popular method was developed by a Persian alchemist by the name of Avicenna in the 10th century—and his process remained unchanged for centuries due to its effective nature. In fact, it is still widely used to this day; however, not without its downsides. Due to the extreme heat required for extraction, many plants and delicate flowers are damaged and unable to be extracted through distillation. Consequently, fragile flowers such as jasmine and tuberose are only able to be processed using methods such as enfleurage or solvent extraction. </p>
            <p><br>The final method of absolute extraction is known as solvent extraction. In the present day, it is the most used technique for extraction due to its effectiveness and large production quantity. Although this technique was developed in the 18th century, its practical application was only possible due to chemical and technological improvements in the 19th century. In this process, flowers are placed into large rotating vats called extractors. To decompose the flowers, a reactive solvent such as hexane or ethanol is added to the vat, leaving behind a waxy substance known as “concrete”. It consists primarily of waxes, resin, and the essential oils attempting to be extracted. Concrete is highly fragrant, but it is too solid to be used in perfumery. To reduce viscosity, another solvent, ethyl alcohol, is then added to break down the concrete. Once dissolved, the waxes and pigments from the concrete are filtered from the oils mixed with the alcohol. The alcohol is then distilled and the final product, the absolute, is taken and used for perfumery. </p>

            </i></p></div>
            <p><br>After the oils have been obtained, the baseline for perfumery is reached. This is where the magic happens. Based on the scent requested, perfumers blend the essential oils to find a combination that matches the vision for the perfume. To achieve this, perfumers analyze a fragrance compartmentally in what is referred to as “fragrance notes”. These notes are the different essential oils and synthetic fragrances that produce the final scent. Similar to their musical counterpart, fragrance notes combined create melodies in a perfume that invoke certain feelings when smelled. Just as the jingling notes of Christmas carols work to bring in that Christmas spirit, fragrance notes like cinnamon, musk, or peppermint might transport you into a winter wonderland as well. Notes are broken down into three layers, known as the top notes, heart notes, and base notes. </p>
            <p><br>The top notes – also referred to as headnotes – are those fresh, maybe tropical scents that can be first detected right after a perfume is sprayed. They make the first impression on a wearer before smoothly transitioning into the other notes and therefore dissipate the quickest after only about five to fifteen minutes. Examples of top notes include citrus scents – such as lemon, orange, or bergamot – and aromatics such as lavender, anise, or basil.The heart or middle notes, come into play as the top notes begin to dissipate and act as the main body of the fragrance. These notes are the ones that can be identified when the perfume begins to blend with your skin to produce that signature scent. They last for the full duration of the perfume – around 20 minutes to an hour, and are composed of full-bodied floral, herbal, or spicy scents like cinnamon, jasmine, or juniper. Finally, the base notes form the foundation of the perfume. They bring the fragrance together – boosting the strength and depth of the other notes while acting as the undertone for the entire fragrance. Base notes come in a little after the heart notes and can last six hours or longer. Some examples of base notes include deep and rich notes like vanilla, musk, or sandalwood. </p>
            <p><br>After a scent has been developed, the oils are blended with a mix of alcohol, water, and preservative compounds that enhance the lifespan and general use of the final product. Depending on the ratio of essential oils in the mixture, a perfume is classified as one of five types. </p>
            <ul class="article-list"><br>
                <li>Parfum has the highest concentration of oils and therefore lasts the longest, with around 20% to 30% and sometimes more. It is also considered the most expensive due to its oil concentration. </li>
                <li>Eau de Parfum comes next at around 15% to 20% concentration, providing a less heavy fragrance that is still decently powerful. </li>
                <li>Eau de Toilette has a concentration of 5% to 15% and is considered a lighter fragrance that can be applied throughout the day, due to its lower concentration, is often less expensive than Parfum or Eau de Parfum. </li>
                <li>Eau de Cologne is 2% to 4%, offering an extremely light fragrance.</li>
                <li>Eau Fraiche is the lightest perfume at only 1% to 3% fragrance in the product. </li>
            </ul>

            <div class="caption"><p><i>A concentration guide of different perfume types (Source: Wikimedia Commons)</i></p></div>
            <p><br>Finally, after the perfumes have been extracted, devised, and blended they are put through an aging process of several months to years. This aging allows the various notes in the perfume to combine and flourish, increasing the vitality and finalizing the perfume’s scent. Perfume testers known in the industry as “noses” judge the fragrance and ensure that it is high quality and ready to be marketed. </p>
            <p><br>Most perfumes are marketed by high fashion brands such as Dior, Chanel, and Gucci. While these brands primarily specialize in fashion and accessories, they also are commonly known for their fragrances. Fashion and fragrance have been in an intimate relationship for more than a century since the Roaring Twenties. Perfume became what it is today due to a combination of factors in the Roaring Twenties. A burning desire for new means of self-expression in opposition to the status quo, the introduction of new fashion trends that challenged traditional femininity, and the introduction of perfume by a renowned fashion house kindled the flames for what would become an international movement. In 1911, Paul Poiret—a French couturier known as the epitome of Art Deco fashion—technically was the first fashion designer to create and market perfume. However, the most impactful perfume of the Roaring Twenties wasn’t launched until around a decade later at the start of the time period. In 1921, Chanel No. 5, created by the fashion house Chanel indisputably became the quintessential feminine scent. Buying into the flapper movement which embraced the liberty of women from traditional etiquette, Coco Chanel made it fashionable to wear her fragrance. Everything that she exemplified—a badass, defiant, and audacious grace, was that which the feminist movement strove for. It is no surprise that her perfume quickly became a fragrant icon. Marketed by Coco Chanel, the fragrance was associated with the new fashion trends of the 1920s and completely redefined the way women chose to express their scent. This was the beginning of high fashion’s fascination with fragrance. </p>
            <p><br> Even today, Chanel No. 5 is still sold, renowned as one of the most legendary perfumes of all time. It was the beginning of a new vision (or rather, scent) for perfumery. The newfound recognition of the expressive implications of perfume turned it into a social phenomenon that many cannot live without. Perfumery is the art of scent. It paints an impression by acting as the fundamental background for human interaction. Wherever you go, whether you realize it or not, your mind is subconsciously attributing all that you smell to your emotions and memories. So the next time you’re thinking about good places for a date, maybe choose somewhere that smells incredible. Wear a nice perfume or cologne. Maybe take a lovely walk by the ocean; a visit to a good coffee shop, or even go shopping at the mall. Create an emotional background for beautiful reminiscence. Regardless, just make sure to avoid a romantic evening at the fish market.</p>
